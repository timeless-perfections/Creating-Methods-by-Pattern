# Creating-Methods-by-Pattern
I have written a "Recursive" method in Java language, without looping, which obeys the following rule according to the n value received from the user. 
Rule : I subtract 5 from the entered number until the entered number is 0 or negative.  
I printed the last value to the screen during each subtraction. 
After the number was negative or 0, I added 5 again.  
Again, I printed the last value of the number on the screen in each addition operation.
